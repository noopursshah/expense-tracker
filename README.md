## An Expense Tracker

As an international university student, I feel highly motivated to code an Expense tracker with the following
objectives in mind:
- Monthly Budget Management : To help students like myself efficiently manage their finances ðŸ’°,
    the application will allow users to set a monthly budget By using this feature, we will be able to allocate 
    our resources more effectively, taking into account international students' tuition fees and living expenses.
- Expense Tracking : The application will facilitate the tracking of expenses on a monthly basis. ðŸ“†
- Expense Visualization : To gain valuable insights into our spending habits, the application will offer 
    visualization tools. These tools will include charts, graphs, and reports that present a clear overview 
    of our monthly expenses. ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

***User Stories***
As a user I should be able to:
- Add details (Date, Description and Amount) of a single transaction to a single Expense record.
- Add a single Expense to a list of Expenses.
- Set a monthly budget limit.
- Be able to host more than one account.
- Deduct the expenditure amount from the particular account balance.
- List all the expenses in my expenses list.
- Add a list of expenses to a Record for each month.
- View my expenses for each month
- Save my expenses i.e record for each month to a file (if I choose)
- Load my expenses for each month i.e record from a file (if I choose)
- Visualize charts on my expenses.

***Instructions for User***
- You can generate the first required action related to the user story "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by inputting the
    required details and removing that item by clicking on remove button.
- Second action is to sort the expenses in the text area by amount by going to the Options menu.
- Find my visual component every time you click on add button to add an expense.
- You can save the state of my application by closing the window and choosing the save option.
- You can load data by choosing that option in my options menu for a particular month.

***PHASE 4: TASK 3***

If given more time, I would like to work on the manner my data is displayed in the JTextFieldArea such that the area
shows me all expenses even after I quit my application. Additionally, my application for the time being pertains to 
only 1 year. In the future, I would want it to work and navigate through the calendar/multiple years.

While it is an expense tracker, I believe the next step would be to add savings as well as income and also visualize
monthly data in the form of charts.
